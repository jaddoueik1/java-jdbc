To start the project first please import mysql-database.sql into ur SQL client to create the database test with its data.

First, you need to add the mysql-connector.jar file to classpath

Then run Main.java using the command javac Main.java, this command will generate a Main.class file.

To see the output please run java Main.

The way this project works, Main will attempt to connect to a mysql database called test, using a username and password provided in Constants.java, please fill the credentials by editing Constants.java to set ur credentials in case of error the compiled class will output the errors.

Thank you.
